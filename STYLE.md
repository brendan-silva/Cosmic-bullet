# Code style
This project conforms to the [PEP 8 style](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#introduction).  

This is achieved by running pylint to check for incorrectly formatted code.
To fix any unformatted code it's recommend to run the python code formatter [black](https://github.com/psf/black).

Black can be installed by running:
```sh
pip install black
```
And to use black it's as simple as:
```sh
black file_name_or_folder
```
